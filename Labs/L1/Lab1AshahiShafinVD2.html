<!-- This is my paragraph and my explaintion --> 
<body> <p> My name is Ashahi Shafin and I'm a web design student, and to me i think web design is a class where you learn what skills you need to make a web site and how can you do it. Web design is also a a place where you can work with many people. In web design we ;earn how to use photoshop, indesign, and more adobe program. With these skills you can get a job for making website for companies and get paid a lot of money. Web design can also help you with college because the collges will see that you have different skill then other people then you have a better chance to get in a college <p>
