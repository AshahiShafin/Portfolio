<p> What I did in this project is I made a banner by using photoshop. I did this by in photoshop I make it 1169X400 then I put my name and didgtal design with the color blue becausew blue is my favorite color, after that I used the paint brush to make the background look like blood because I thought it will look cool and save it. Also made a name plate by changing the size of the psd and then I didn't just my name and add the blood banckground that I made, I also save all then as JPG. I choose to make it like this because mainly becacuse blue and red together looks good. </p>
