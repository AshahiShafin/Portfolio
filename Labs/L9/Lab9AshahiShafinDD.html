<h1>My Plan For AP Exam
</h1>
<h2>BY: Ashahi Shafin
</h2>
<p>My plan is to make a big study sheet so I can review for it, get help from other because they might now something I don't know, Code.Stuido because that let me to practice question, I can read my notes, ask teacher for help because she's the one who thaught me this, but at the sametime she might tell me just to review my note. If I do this I'll be able to pass this test to have a high grade in my class.</p>
<li>Study sheet</li>
<li>Ask my class mate for help</li>
<li>Code.stuido</li>
<li>Read not</li>
<li>Ask teacher for help</li>
<h2>Create and Explor</h2>
<p>The create and explor seccsion is when you got to google trends and search up a group of commod thing such as what people watch the most and then you anlaized it to expalin and make a story about it. This can take about 4 hours because it's alot of work do and like lioke an essay. In order to do this you will have to make graph they expain your story make sure that you can the reader cand read it bcause theb you will not get a good grade.</p>
